    """Determine the current phase and when the active phase is.

    The "actual phase" of the contest for a certain user is the status
    in which the contest is presented to the user and determines the
    information the latter is allowed to see (and the actions he is
    allowed to perform). In general it may be different for each user.

    The phases, and their meaning, are the following:
    * -2: the user cannot compete because the contest hasn't started
          yet;
    * -1: the user cannot compete because, even if the contest has
          already started, its per-user time frame hasn't yet (this
          usually means the user still has to click on the "start!"
          button in USACO-like contests);
    * 0: the user can compete;
    * +1: the user cannot compete because, even if the contest hasn't
          stopped yet, its per-user time frame already has (again, this
          should normally happen only in USACO-like contests);
    * +2: the user cannot compete because the contest has already
          stopped and the analysis mode hasn't started yet.
    * +3: the user can take part in analysis mode.
    * +4: the user cannot compete because the contest has already
          stopped. analysis mode has already finished or has been
          disabled for this contest.
    A user is said to "compete" if he can read the tasks' statements,
    submit solutions, see their results, etc.

    This function returns the actual phase at the given timestamp, as
    well as its boundaries (i.e. when it started and will end, with
    None meaning +/- infinity) and the boundaries of the phase 0 (if it
    is defined, otherwise None).

    timestamp (datetime): the current time.
    contest_start (datetime): the contest's start.
    contest_stop (datetime): the contest's stop.
    per_user_time (timedelta|None): the amount of time allocated to
        each user; if it's None the contest is traditional, otherwise
        it's USACO-like.
    starting_time (datetime|None): when the user started their time
        frame.
    delay_time (timedelta): how much the user's start is delayed.
    extra_time (timedelta): how much extra time is given to the user at
        the end.

    return (tuple): 5 items: an integer (in [-2, +2]) and two pairs of
        datetimes (or None) defining two intervals.
